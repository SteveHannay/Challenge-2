# Challenge 2 

Challenge 2 - Project for module 02-css-module 
Task - Build a Portfolio webpage

Developer - Steve Hannay
Completed - 11th December 2023


## Description

The aim of this project is to create a webpage to display a portfolio of the different websites which I have built during the Bootcamp (it currently contains mainly dummy webpages, but will be updated as I create more webpages in the future).

The following acceptance criteria was set for by the Bootcamp team for my portfolio webpage
* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

During the process of working on this project I have learned more about the fundamentals of structured HTML and CSS coding, including the use of Flex boxes and images. 

Furthermore, I have become a little more familiar with working with GitHub and ReadMe files.


## Installation

Open the following webpage from any internet browser.

![link to Horiseon webpage](https://stevehannay.github.io/Challenge-2/)

No installation is necessary. 


## Usage

This is a very simple webpage to use.

The top navigation panel provides navigation to the About Me, Work and Contact Details sections of the webpage.

The screenshots of the webpages displayed (the ones that I have already created) are clickable, so that the user can naviagate to them.


Here are screenshots of the webpage created for the project.
